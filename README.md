# Chat Assignment
This project is a simple chatbot that uses the GPT-4 model to answer user queries. It also has the ability to handle mathematical expressions in the responses.

## Setup
### Requirements
- Python 3 (Python3)
- pip (pip3)
- OpenAI (or Azure) API key

### Installation steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hashiraee/ChatAssignment.git`
2. Setup virtual environment & install dependencies:
- `cd ChatAssignment`
- `make install`
- (Or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)

## Usage
1. Make sure you are in the root of the `ChatAssignment` directory
2. Add either the `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env.local` file
3. `make run "QUERY"`
4. (Or `python3 code/chat.py "QUERY"`)

### Example Usage (when the query is related to the LLM papers):
**Input:** `python3 code/chat.py "Can you give a description of the different Gemini models"`

**Output:** The Gemini family of models consists of three main sizes, each designed for different applications:

1. **Ultra**: This is the most capable model in the Gemini family, delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of highly complex tasks, including reasoning and multimodal tasks. It is optimized for efficient serving at scale on Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) thanks to the Gemini architecture.

2. **Pro**: ...

### Example Usage (not related to the papers in the `papers` directory):
**Input:** `python3 code/chat.py "Can you give a concise description of the vehicle routing problem?"`

**Output:** The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem that seeks to deliver goods to various locations using a fleet of vehicles dispatched from a depot. The objective is to minimize the total route cost, which could include factors like distance, time, or fuel consumption, while satisfying constraints such as vehicle capacity, delivery time windows, and sometimes the requirement that each customer is visited exactly once. It is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where instead of one route, multiple routes are constructed for the fleet of vehicles.

### Example Usage (mathematical expressions):
**Input:** `python3 code/chat.py "What is 2843740 divided by 367 after first subtracting 1000?"`

**Output:**
\`\`\`python

result = (2843740 - 1000) / 367

print(result)

\`\`\`

Code written to ./output/math_expression.py

**Note:** we could evaluate the Python expression to get the answer, but we must be careful with executing code generated by an LLM. Therefore, the code to evaluate the mathematical expression is written to `output/math_expression.py`.

After inspecting the code, we can run the code by issuing the following command:
- `make calculate`
- (Or `python3 output/math_expression.py`)
